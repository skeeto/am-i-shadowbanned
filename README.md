# Reddit shadowban test tool

## What's a shadowban?

When a user is shadowbanned they can continue to make posts and leave
comments without any indication of the ban. However, *everything* they
do is automatically marked as spam. No one will see any of it until
the post or comment is graciously freed by a moderator, if ever. To
the moderator, the post title appears will appear as strikethrough in
addition to the normal red background.

This tool can test whether an account is shadowbanned, normal, or
non-existent. It uses [CORS Anywhere][cors] to work around the
cross-domain issue.
